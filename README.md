## How To Run Source Code

First you have to download whole project source code.Then create a Database. 

Open Source Code.Go to Database Folder , open 'avada40new.sql' from any texteditor. Next open readme.txt and copy the text. Then 'replace all' this  text from avada40new.sql to 'path where you keep your source code'. 

Example:  http://localhost/avada40new ===> replace all ===> http://rh-rumman/wordpress/avada

Now go to phpmyadmin & select your database. Import this sql file.

Put your code to your exact location.Your folder name must be 'avada40new' where you put your code.

Open "wp-config.php". Change DB_NAME,DB_USER & DB_PASSWORD as you set.

**Admin Panel : Username => 'rumman' & Password => 'rumman57'**

Go To Settings->Permalinks. In common settings select 'Post Name' & Save Changes.     
#### That's All.Thanks.
